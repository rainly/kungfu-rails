======

A Ruby on Rails plugin for Tenpay (Online pay solution from Tencent).

Install
=======

$ script/plugin install git://github.com/yzhang/tenpay.git

Usage
=======

1. After you installing the plugin, there should be a tenpay.yml 
in your RAILS_ENV/config dir, you should edit that file and set
your spid and key you got from Tencent.

2. To start a transaction, you will need create a new Tenpay::Request 
instance, for example:

  @request = Tenpay::Request.new('test product', # Product name
                  1, # Order id, should be unique
                  4500, # Product price, in cent
                  'http://return', # Url user will return after the transaction, support Get/Post
                  'attach data') # Attach data, will be pass to the return url.
  redirect_to @request.url

This will redirect user to pay page.

3. After user finishing the paying, the return url will be called, below
code will demo if the request is legal and user finish the paying.

  @response = Tenpay::Response.new(params)
  if @response.successful?
    # paying is successful
  else
    # it's failed
  end
